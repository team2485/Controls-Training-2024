     * You will want to write this class with the guidance of this document, or at least the latter portion....
     * https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XcUJPxMh9GqO4A-GVb6mW3it_Yp4bLcdosbXM8OW3I/edit?usp=sharing
     * 
     * The GeneralRoller class is representative of any roller that makes contact with a note. Specifically, all rollers on Vivaldi use SparkMaxes, 
     * so the framework in this class is designed around them. Your goal is to fill the missing methods. Some variables have been provided for you,
     * but others will need to be programmed in based on your approach--- remember, programming is problem-solving, and there's multiple ways to 
     * validly complete this excersise. You may look at the Team2485/frc-2024 repo for reference, but we need you to explain the code you wrote in your
     * groups back to us. Documentation for all of the WPILib provided classes is available online:
     * Documentation sources:
     * 
     * https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/cansparkmax | Documentation for the CANSparkMax class, which is the motor controller you'll use.
     *  ^^^ can also navigate to other pages on these docs to find other classes related to SparkMax's, etc 
     * https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/api-usage/api-overview.html | API reference for Cross the Road Electronics. Won't help too much here specifically.
     * https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html | provides docs for a lot of stuff you probably won't use here, like competition APIs. Still a good tool.
